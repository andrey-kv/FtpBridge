1. Gets data from the file via FTP. Files can be of different names. Read everything from the folder
 and add them to DB to collection "flight_records".
 Read files line by line. Search necessary names (CSV using DFDL; field delimiter: " " ; record delimiter "new line").
 Files could have incorrect lines.
 Write it to the log but do not interrupt the work when that happens.
 
 2. REST webservice. Accepts requests:
 RS_WS 
{
	"firstname": "<F_N>",
	"lastname": "L_N",
	"flightnumber": "F_NUM"
}
 and adds to 2 collections in Mongo as a result
 (use upsert: true; for that indexing of query fields is needed: (firstname,lastname), (flightnumber))
 "users"
 "flights"
 
 The response should be a JSON response:
 "The record has been updated"
 "The record has been inserted"
 "Error"
 "required field ..."
 "incorrect type or field ..."
 
 3. Bridge between flows. Job will be working each 10 minutets. (CRON setup)
 Takes all records from collection "flight_records" and pushes them one by one to the REST WS.
 Should have a good log which would write everything it has done.
 Should have a cursor: to keep the last read record in the collection.
 When the flow has stopped working, the cursor should be updated.
